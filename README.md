Explanation
1. 4-bit Adder Module (adder_4bit)
Inputs:

A[3:0] and B[3:0]: These are 4-bit binary numbers that will be added together.
Cin: This is the carry input (usually 0 unless you want to add an extra carry).
Outputs:

Sum[3:0]: The 4-bit sum output of the addition.
Cout: The carry output that results from the addition of the most significant bit (MSB) of the two numbers.
The 4-bit adder is structured using full adders for each individual bit. Each full adder takes two bits (one from each input A and B) and the carry from the previous less significant bit's addition.

The Cout of the most significant bit (MSB) is the final carry-out of the addition, which may be used to detect overflow.

2. Full Adder Module (full_adder)
A full adder is a combinational circuit that adds two 1-bit binary numbers, along with an input carry bit, and produces a sum bit and a carry bit as output.

Inputs:

A and B: The two 1-bit binary inputs.
Cin: The carry-in input, which could be 0 or 1.
Outputs:

Sum: The sum of the bits A, B, and Cin.
Cout: The carry-out, which can be used in the next higher bit's addition.
The full adder works based on the following Boolean equations:

Sum = A XOR B XOR Cin: The sum bit is the XOR of the two input bits and the carry-in.
Cout = (A AND B) OR (Cin AND (A XOR B)): The carry-out is 1 if at least two of the inputs are 1.
3. Working of the 4-bit Adder
The 4-bit adder adds two 4-bit numbers bit by bit, starting from the least significant bit (LSB) to the most significant bit (MSB).
Each bit addition is handled by a full adder. The carry-out (Cout) from one full adder is fed into the carry-in (Cin) of the next higher bit's full adder.
The sum of each bit is stored in the Sum output.
After all four bits are added, the final carry-out from the MSB (bit 3) is stored in Cout.
Example
Letâ€™s say:

A = 4'b1101 (which is 13 in decimal)
B = 4'b1011 (which is 11 in decimal)
Cin = 0
The addition process would be as follows:

css
Copy code
    A = 1101
  + B = 1011
  --------
  Sum = 11000
  Cout = 1
The sum of A and B is 11000, which is a 5-bit number. The 4-bit sum (1100) is stored in the Sum output, and the carry-out Cout is 1, indicating an overflow since the result requires 5 bits to represent.

Explanation of the Code
1. Inputs and Outputs
Inputs:
A[3:0]: A 4-bit binary number.
B[3:0]: A 4-bit binary number.
Output:
P[7:0]: An 8-bit binary product of the two 4-bit numbers.
2. Partial Products
Multiplication in binary works by generating partial products for each bit of the multiplier (B). For each bit B[i], we generate a partial product by multiplying the multiplicand A by B[i] and then shifting it left by i positions. This corresponds to multiplying A by each bit of B, scaled by powers of 2.

Partial product generation:
partial_sum_0: This represents A * B[0], where B[0] is the least significant bit of B. If B[0] is 1, this is just A. If B[0] is 0, this partial product is 0.

partial_sum_1: This represents A * B[1], but shifted left by 1 bit (<< 1). If B[1] is 1, this partial product is A shifted by one place. If B[1] is 0, this partial product is 0.

partial_sum_2: This represents A * B[2], shifted left by 2 bits (<< 2).

partial_sum_3: This represents A * B[3], shifted left by 3 bits (<< 3).

Each of these partial products is a shifted version of A based on the bit of B that is being considered.

3. Final Product Calculation
The final product is obtained by adding up all the partial products:

css
Copy code
P = partial_sum_0 + partial_sum_1 + partial_sum_2 + partial_sum_3
This sum gives the 8-bit product of the two 4-bit numbers.

Example
Let's take the numbers:

A = 4'b1011 (which is 11 in decimal)
B = 4'b1101 (which is 13 in decimal)
Now, let's calculate the product:

css
Copy code
    A = 1011
  x B = 1101
  --------
We will generate the partial sums:

Partial product for B[0] (least significant bit):
A * B[0] = 1011 * 1 = 1011
partial_sum_0 = 1011 (no shift needed).

Partial product for B[1]:
A * B[1] = 1011 * 1 = 1011, but shifted left by 1 bit:
partial_sum_1 = 10110.

Partial product for B[2]:
A * B[2] = 1011 * 0 = 0000, but shifted left by 2 bits:
partial_sum_2 = 0000.

Partial product for B[3]:
A * B[3] = 1011 * 1 = 1011, but shifted left by 3 bits:
partial_sum_3 = 1011000.

Now, add all these partial products:

yaml
Copy code
       1011
    + 10110
    + 0000
    + 1011000
    ---------
    10011011
So, the product P = 10011011, which is 143 in decimal. This is the result of multiplying A and B.

Key Concepts:
Bitwise AND (&): This is used to mask each bit of A with the corresponding bit of B. This generates the partial products.
Left Shifts (<<): Shifting the partial products to align them with the correct place value.
Addition: Finally, the partial products are summed to get the final product.
Optimization Considerations:
This is a simple, direct implementation of a multiplier using partial products. For larger numbers or more efficient designs, you could consider using more advanced algorithms like Booth's multiplication or implement a Wallace tree for faster addition of partial products.
